Project Title- "Crafting a Dictionary and Phone Directory with Tries"

Description:
  Our project focuses on the implementation and analysis of Tries data
structure.It is a tree based data structure that is used for storing some collection of
strings and performing efficient search operations on them.

his data structure is useful for preserving storage space as strings with com-
mon prefixes have common ancestors.Tries are extensively used for purposes like Efficient Prefix Searches and Fast Autocomplete.
We have demonstarted these operations in our project along with analysis and pseudo code.
